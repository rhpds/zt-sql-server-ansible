== View and edit the Ansible Playbook

*Playbook* A playbook is an entirely different way of running Ansible,
that is far more powerful. In Ansible, a playbook is a yaml file
consisting of multiple plays.

A play is a set of tasks mapped to a set of hosts.

*Editing variables in a playbook*

You should notice a new tab in which you can edit `+site.yml+` in the
inline editor.

This file has several variables, and one example variable that you might
optionally want to change is the database sa password.

Youâ€™ll also notice that `+site.yml+` includes the firewall RHEL system
role, which opens the mssql port. You can learn more about the firewall
RHEL system role in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Firewall System Role
lab.
