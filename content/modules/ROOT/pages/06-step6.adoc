== Connect to SQL Server and Query Data

Now, let’s open up the sqlcmd shell prompt connected to the *pubs*
database created by the ansible playbook in SQL Server. A sample data
set has been created for you in `+InstPubs.sql+`, we will import it in
this step.

If you haven’t changed the sa password in the previous step, you should
be able to successfully execute the command below and run the script to
install the pubs data in the testDB database.

[source,bash]

/opt/mssql-tools18/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P p@55w0rD -N -C -i ./InstPubs.sql
